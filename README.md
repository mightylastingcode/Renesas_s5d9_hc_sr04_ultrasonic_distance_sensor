# Renesas_s5d9_hc_sr04_ultrasonic_distance_sensor
 Add Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to S5D9 IOT board.

Project Goals

Learn to connect the 5V popular distance sensor to the 3.3V S5D9 IOT board.

Use one shot timer to generate the trigger pulse to start sensing.

Use timer and input interrupt to measure the return echo pulse from the sensor.
